In Docker, **one stage is equal to one independent environment** during the image-building process. Each stage has its own isolated file system and build context, and it can execute commands (like copying files or running builds) independently.

Here’s what it means practically:

---

### **What is a Stage?**
- A **stage** is defined by the `FROM` keyword in the Dockerfile. 
- Every time `FROM` is used, it creates a new stage.
- You can name each stage with an alias using `AS` (e.g., `FROM base AS builder`).

---

### **Key Characteristics of a Stage**
1. **Isolated Environment**:
   - Each stage has its own file system.
   - Files created in one stage are not accessible in another stage unless explicitly copied using `COPY --from=...`.

2. **Reusability**:
   - A stage can prepare assets (e.g., build code or compile binaries) and pass them to another stage using `COPY --from`.

3. **No Dependency on Previous Stages**:
   - Stages are independent unless you choose to reference them (`COPY --from`).

---

### **Example**
Here’s how two stages interact:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build  # Builds app into /app/build

# Stage 2: Runner
FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

- **Stage 1 (builder)**:
  - Installs dependencies and builds the app.
  - The final build output is stored in `/app/build`.
  
- **Stage 2 (runner)**:
  - Only copies the `/app/build` directory from Stage 1 into the Nginx container.
  - Stage 1’s other files (like `node_modules` or source files) are not carried over.

---

### **Summary**
- **1 Stage = 1 Independent Environment**.
- Multiple stages are used in **multi-stage builds** to optimize and streamline the final Docker image by isolating concerns (e.g., building code, running the app).
- Only the artifacts you explicitly transfer (`COPY --from`) are included in the next stage or the final output.
